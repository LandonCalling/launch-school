---------------- Problem
Restate Problem: write a calculator program that asks a user for two numbers 
and asks the user whether they would like to add, subtract, multiply or divide,
and then perform that operation.

Input: two numbers, operator

Output: result of operation

Rules: 
  - must be able to handle floats as well as integers
  - must put all screen output in a separate yaml file
  - must translate screen output to at least one other language
  - must improve on number validation
  - must look out for division by zero
   
---------------- Modelling / Examples

2, 3, + => 5.00
2., .5, * => 1.00
2.5, 3, - => -0.50
-4, ,2 / => -2.00
11, 5, + => 16.00
12.5, 2, * => 25.00
3.55, 4.61, + => 8.16


---------------- Data Structures
Use regex for number validation
use array to store number inputs from user
use hash to store messages for screen output (in yaml file)

---------------- Scratchpad


---------------- Algorithm
- Read in calculator messages file and store as variable
- Welcome and Language selection
  - welcome the user
  - output to screen possible languages
  - ask user for language selection
  - user inputs selection
  - verify selection is in list of possible choices
  - if not valid selection output error message and do again
  - return user choice
- get a number from the user (twice)
  - ask user to input a number
  - user inputs number
  - verify that it is a valid number
  - if not valid output error message and do again
  - return number
- get operation from the user
  - output to screen possible operation choices
  - ask user for operation selection
  - user inputs selection
  - verify selection is in list of possible choices
  - if not valid selection output error message and do again
  - return operation choice
- if the user chose division, check second number
  - if second number is zero go back to start and ask for two numbers again
- perform operation
  - add, subtract, multiply or divide
  - return result
- output to the screen
  - format result so that it only has 2 decimal points
- Do they want to try again?
  - ask user if they want to try again
  - user inputs answer
  - verify that it is a valid answer
- Break unless they want to try again
