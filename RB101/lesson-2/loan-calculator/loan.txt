---------------- Problem
Restate Problem: Build a mortgage calculator that takes three inputs: loan
amount, APR, and loan duration.  Calculate the monthly payment using the
following formula:

m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))

m = monthly payment
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months

Input: 
  - loan amount
  - annual percentage rate (APR) (in % form not decimal form)
  - loan duration (in years)

Output: 
  - monthly payment

Rules: 
  - need to calc monthly interest rate from APR
  - need to calculate loan duration in months from input of loan duration
    in years
  - need to verify all inputs

---------------- Modelling / Examples
100_000, 5, 30 => 536.82
300_000, 4.5, 25 => 1667.50
250_000, 2.5, 30.5 => 976.93

Verification Tests:
  - loan amount input
    - rules:
      - loan amount must be a number (no letters, other chars but period)
      - loan amount must be positive
      - loan amount must be non zero
  - APR input
    - rules:
      - APR must be a number (no letters, other chars but period)
      - APR must be a positive number between 0-30e inclusive
  - loan duration input
    - rules:
      - loan duration must be either an integer or a float that ends
        in .5

---------------- Algorithm
- Welcome
- Get loan amount
  - ask user how much the loan amount is
  - get user input
  - verify input is valid input
  - try again unless valid
  - return loan amount
- Get APR
  - ask user how much the apr is
  - get user input
  - verify input is valid input
  - try again unless valid
  - return APR
- Get loan duration in years
  - ask user what the loan duration is in years (integer)
  - get user input
  - verify input is valid input
    - positive integer
  - try again unless valid input
  - ask user what the loan duration is in months (integer)
  - get user input
  - verify input is valid input
    - positive integer
  - try again unless valid input
  - return loan duration
- calculate monthly interest rate
  - apr / 12
- calculate loan duration in months
  - loan duration in years * 12
- calculate monthly payment
  - input montly interest rate, loan amount, and loan duration in months
  - calculate monthly payment
  - return monthly payment
- print results
- Ask the user if they would like to try again
  - ask the user if they would like to try again
  - get user input
  - verify input is valid input
  - return answer
- Break unless they want to try again.
