Exception handling allows you to handle errors in a manageable
and predictable way.  In the real world, you don't want your 
app to stop running because one of your users put in bad info,
or pressed the wrong button.  This allows you to catch the error
that would normally stop the app from running and print to the 
screen a bunch of what would look like garbage to an end user 
and replace it with a readable message.
