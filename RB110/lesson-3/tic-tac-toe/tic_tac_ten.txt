---------------- Problem
Restate Problem:
  Tic Tac Ten is a 2 player game played on a 3x3 master board.  Each square in
  the master board contains a 3x3 mini tic-tac-toe board. First player marks any
  square on the board.  From then on, each player takes a turn and the 
  mini tic-tac-toe board they play on is determined by the location of the last
  players mark. A win on a mini board determines who gets the square on the
  master board.  First person to reach three squares in a row on the master
  board wins.  If all 9 squares are marked and no player has 3 squares in a row,
  then the game is a tie.
